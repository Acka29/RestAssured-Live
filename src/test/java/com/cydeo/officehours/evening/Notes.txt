API : Interface between applications - middle man

API Testing: With your Request, you have expected Response from the other application,
checking if your response from the app is as expected

Two Key elements of API Testing
Request : fundamental elements of making a request
       * END Point of API: URI
       * Path Parameters: part of the URL
       * Query Parameters : Filtering option of request, everything that comes after "?" in the URL, not considered as part of the URL

Response : How to read and analyze the response
        we get JSON format,
        What is JSON : Javascript Object Notation
        Car = {
               'model' : 'Honda',
               'yearMade' : 1995
               }
        [] : represents Javascript Array Object - similar to ArrayList in JAVA

Why Oscar likes API Testing ?
    * Faster
    * Coverage of the features is High
    * UI testing focuses on look and feel part of the application mostly
    * API testing focuses on business layer application

   Applications have different environments: Production (user sees this one) + BackUp Production(mirror), Pre-production(Stage), Testing Env

As a Tester We check couple of things:
 * most important one : Status Code
            - 2XX -- OK, created ...
            - 3XX -- re-directs testing 301, 302
            - 4XX -- 401, 403, 404
 * Content-type :
 * Headers : Date etc.
 * Body testing : string, path, JsonPath ....

Challenging Task: (totally optional, and little bit hard)
- create a cucumber framework that can do API and UI test together
- By using BookStore API Swagger Document, create a user from API
- and with this user Login from UI side and verify user information
